        <p>
            <u>Passive  Mode</u>=The AP advertise its  service by periodically sending broadcast beacon frames containing  the SSIDs supported standards and security settings,clients must be told that this networks are available anywhere,this allows them to choose network and an AP to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Active Mode</u>=Wireless must know this of the SSID,the client initiates the process by broadcasting a probe request frame on multiple channels,the probe requets SSID name and standard  supported  clients can send probe request without SSID name to discover nearby  WLANs networks,APs with the broadcast SSID feature disabled do not respond.
